    "## 🔑 What is a Key?\n",
    "- A **key** is an attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row (tuple) in a table (relation).\n",
    "- Keys help enforce **data integrity**, **uniqueness**, and establish **relationships between tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ Why Keys Are Important\n",
    "- Uniquely identify each record, even in large tables with duplicates.\n",
    "- Enforce **identity and integrity**.\n",
    "- Create **relationships between tables** (e.g., via foreign keys).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Split data into tables where each non-key attribute depends on the full key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "Student_id | Course_id | Percent_Completed  --> OK  \n",

    "- Example: Can’t insert a student without course info unless nulls are allowed.\n",
